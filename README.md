# malakbel-bot

This is my personal Discord bot for the time being

### Looking to implement :
- Asking availabilities from players on server
- Google API
- Maybe League API also

## Installation

Download the source and put it in an approriate folder where you want to run the bot from
```

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - v8 or higher
* [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) - Needed to run better-sqlite3
* [Discord token](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) - Setup your own Discord bot

```

### Create .env in the main directory and put the following lines inside:
```

PREFIX=!
```

```
npm run dev
```
